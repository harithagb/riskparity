# riskparity

This repository has all the code for my research work under Prof. Conklin. The aim is to investigate the historical performance of risk parity and test the underlying assumptions that the market has about risk parity. 

- A hypothesis that I'm particularly interested in is that the equity Sharpe would have to be reasonably equal to the term premium of bonds.
